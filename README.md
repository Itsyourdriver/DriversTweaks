# DriversTweaks
DriversTweaks is a minecraft 1.19+ datapack that changes parts of the vanilla game, adds features, and makes the vanilla experience more enjoyable.

## Changes

- Wither Skeletons have a tiny change to spawn in soul sand valleys.
- [VanillaTweaks.net] Back To Blocks
- [VanillaTweaks.net] Double Sabs
- [VanillaTweaks.net] Blackstone to Cobblestone
- [VanillaTweaks.net] More Trapdoors, Stairs, Bricks
- [VanillaTweaks.net] Craftable Gravel, Bundles (Rabbit Hide)
- Unpackable Minecarts
- Unpackable Honeycomb
- ~~Anvil Repairing~~
- Craftable Rooted Dirt




## Recommendations
- Have a solid server if running this in multiplayer, as the wither skeleton spawning is ineffecient to my knowledge.
- Understand that this is still in beta and is a work-in-progress. **Bugs will be present!**



# Installation 

Download the most recent tag from the releases section in the repo.
Open the .zip, and copy the .zip inside of there into the "datapacks" folder in your main world or into the temporary datapack folder when creating a world.
**If you find any bugs or are unsure on how to install, join the support server.**
