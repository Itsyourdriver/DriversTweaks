# DriversTweaks
DriversTweaks is a minecraft 1.19+ datapack that changes parts of the vanilla game, adds features, and makes the vanilla experience more enjoyable.



## Changes

- Wither Skeletons have a tiny change to spawn in soul sand valleys.
- [VanillaTweaks.net] Back To Blocks
- [VanillaTweaks.net] Double Sabs
- [VanillaTweaks.net] Blackstone to Cobblestone
- [VanillaTweaks.net] More Trapdoors, Stairs, Bricks
- [VanillaTweaks.net] Craftable Gravel, Bundles (Rabbit Hide)
- Unpackable Minecarts
- Unpackable Honeycomb
- ~~Anvil Repairing~~
- Craftable Rooted Dirt




## Recommendations
- Have a solid server if running this in multiplayer, as the wither skeleton spawning is ineffecient to my knowledge.
- Understand that this is still in beta and is a work-in-progress. **Bugs will be present!**
